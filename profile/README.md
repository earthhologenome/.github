# Welcome to the Earth Hologenome Initiative

The Earth Hologenome Initiative is a global effort established to advance and streamline hologenomic research on wild organisms across the world. It embraces a variety of projects with different research designs and objectives focused on standardised and openly accessible methods for collecting and preserving samples, generating data, and managing data. Through the formation of a consortium and the development of a transparent database, our aim is to encourage collaboration and improve the efficiency of data generation and analysis.

## Contents of this Organisational Repository

### EHI bioinformatic pipeline
The EHi bioinformatic pipeline is the core resource for standardised EHI data generation. The pipeline generates processed raw data to generate standardised outputs for animal genomic and microbial metagenomic analyses by interconnecting the EHI's internal relational database (where metadata and management data are stored), the University of Copenhagen's Electronic Research Data Archive (where research data are stored), and the Globe Institute's Mjolnir HPC (where computation is conducted). A standalone deployable version of the pipeline is under development.
